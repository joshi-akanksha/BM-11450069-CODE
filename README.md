# BM-11450069-CODE
This project analyzes UK household electricity use (2020–2023) with SERL smart-meter data. Methods include SARIMA/SARIMAX forecasting, UMAP–HDBSCAN clustering, and tariff simulation. Results show falling demand but stable evening peaks, highlighting inequities and supporting equity-focused demand-response design.

## Overview

This repository accompanies the MSc dissertation **“Towards Equitable Energy: Temporal Load Modelling for Inclusive Demand-Response.”** It studies how temporal structure (e.g., the evening peak) persists despite falling average consumption, and how subgroup differences (heating type, PV, efficiency, region, deprivation) shape forecasting accuracy and tariff exposure. Methods emphasise interpretability and policy relevance.

**Core modules**

* **EDA:** seasonal/diurnal structure, subgroup contrasts, distributional diagnostics.
* **Forecasting:** SARIMA/SARIMAX baselines with weather covariates; expanding-window backtests.
* **Clustering:** feature engineering of load-shape vectors; UMAP embedding; HDBSCAN density clustering.
* **Tariff simulation:** half-hourly cost exposure under dynamic vs flat tariffs; equity-oriented comparisons.

## Data access (SERL Study 8963)

Analyses use the **Smart Energy Research Lab (SERL) Study 8963, 2020–2023** aggregated statistics (daily and half-hourly). Access is via the UK Data Service under safeguarded/End User Licence terms.

* Obtain credentials, accept the licence, and download the daily and half-hourly aggregated files for 2020–2023.
* Store them locally (e.g., `data/serl_8963/`) and update the notebooks’ `DATA_DIR` variable accordingly.
* Respect disclosure controls; publish only allowed aggregates.

## Environment & setup

Tested with **Python ≥ 3.10** (3.11 recommended).

```bash
# 1) Create environment
python -m venv .venv
# or: conda create -n equitable-energy python=3.11

# 2) Activate
source .venv/bin/activate            # macOS/Linux
#    or: .venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

# 3) Install core libraries
pip install -U pip wheel
pip install pandas numpy scipy statsmodels scikit-learn umap-learn hdbscan \
            matplotlib plotly jupyter ipywidgets pydantic requests

# Optional (for tidy plots and exporting)
pip install kaleido openpyxl
```

*Jupyter extensions:* The notebooks use `ipywidgets`; if widgets don’t render, run:

```bash
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
```

## Reproducibility & run order

For a clean end-to-end replication, execute notebooks **in the following sequence**:

1. **EDA - UnivariateYearly.ipynb** – yearly/seasonal/diurnal structure; basic metrics.
2. **EDA - BiandMultivariate.ipynb** – subgroup contrasts (EPC, IMD, heating, PV, region).
3. **EDA - NumericAnalysis.ipynb** – distributional diagnostics; load factor, skew/kurtosis.
4. **TemporalForecasting.ipynb** – SARIMA/SARIMAX (with meteorology); expanding-window backtests; export `sarima_forecasts.csv` and `forecast_12mo_per_subgroup.csv`.
5. **DemandModelling.ipynb** – feature engineering; UMAP→HDBSCAN; export `clustering_results.csv` and `subgroup_ratios_and_clusters.csv`.
6. **TariffSimulation.ipynb** – merge half-hourly demand with tariff schedules; compute exposure vs flat tariffs; export scenario tables.
7. **Bibliometric\_Analyis.ipynb** – literature scan and figures supporting the methodological framing.

**Seeds & determinism.** Where applicable, notebooks set random seeds for embeddings/clusterers; GPU is **not required**. Some algorithms (UMAP/HDBSCAN) can exhibit minor non-determinism; fix `random_state` to stabilise runs.

## Key outputs

* `sarima_forecasts.csv` — regional/monthly forecasts with prediction intervals.
* `subgroup_forecasts.csv` & `forecast_12mo_per_subgroup.csv` — subgroup-level forecast panels.
* `clustering_results.csv` & `subgroup_ratios_and_clusters.csv` — UMAP/HDBSCAN cluster labels and prevalence by subgroup.
* `forcasting.csv` — original exported results (filename preserved).

These CSVs are produced by the forecasting, clustering, and tariff notebooks and feed the figures/tables in the dissertation.

---

## Tariff simulation notes

* The tariff notebook aligns half-hourly demand with time-varying unit rates (e.g., Agile-type products).
* Public endpoints often suffice, but if an API key/region code is required, set environment variables (e.g., `OCTOPUS_REGION`, `OCTOPUS_API_KEY`) and follow the notebook’s prompts.
* Outputs compare **dynamic vs flat** exposure by persona/cluster and flag potential regressive effects.

---

## Results at a glance

* Mean annual consumption declines over 2020–2023, but the **evening peak persists** across years, seasons, and subgroups.
* SARIMAX with meteorology improves error relative to seasonal-naïve baselines in most regions (policy-grade, interpretable gains).
* UMAP→HDBSCAN reveals **behavioural regimes** (e.g., gas-heavy winters, PV-driven midday troughs).
* Dynamic tariffs can advantage flexible/PV personas but risk **regressive exposure** for inflexible, high-load winter regimes—supporting **segmented, equity-by-design** policies.
